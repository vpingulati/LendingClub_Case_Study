# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending to 'high-risk' borrowers is the leading cause of credit loss. Credit loss represents the money a lender loses when borrowers fail to repay or abscond with owed funds.

The primary goal is to pinpoint these risky loan applicants, reducing such loans to minimize credit loss. The focus of this case study is to identify such applicants through EDA.

Conduct an analysis to grasp the key factors (or influential variables) behind loan defaultsâ€”those variables strongly signaling default. The company can apply this insight to portfolio management and risk assessment.

## Conclusions
- Borrowers are more likely to default when their DTI is between 12 and 18, investors fund amounts ranging from 5,000 to 10,000, the requested loan amount falls between 5,000 and 10,000, monthly installments are between 145K and 274K, the loan term is 36 months, the loan status is unverified, applicants have incomes between 31,000 and 58,000, they receive interest rates from 13% to 17%, the loan purpose is 'debt consolidation,' they have 2 to 10 open accounts, house ownership is 'RENT,' and they have had 0 inquiries in the last 6 months.
- Candidates with specific loan attributes, such as 'MORTGAGE' home ownership, particular income ranges, and interest rate brackets, exhibit a higher likelihood of defaulting. Additionally, loans for home improvement, specific loan amounts, verification of the source, loan grades, and purposes like debt consolidation are associated with increased default risk.
